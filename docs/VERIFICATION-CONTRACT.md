# Verification Contract

This document defines what the compiler promises to reject, how a diagnostic is
classified, and what each classification costs the user. It is the normative
reference for `--classic` and `--strict`; `PLAN.md` §2 is the rationale.

## The guarantee

> In `--strict` mode the compiler statically rejects every program in which a
> *recognition impossible*, a builtin domain error, or a dead sentence is
> reachable.
>
> It does not and cannot prove absence of logic errors or non-termination — see
> Turchin 1980, §5.8, Theorem 5.1.

The second paragraph is not boilerplate. Turchin proves there is no algorithm
that transforms any graph of states into an equivalent perfect graph, by
modelling formal arithmetic in Refal and reducing to Church's theorem. A tool
claiming to certify a Refal program free of bugs is claiming to have refuted
Church. This one claims something narrower and mechanically checkable.

## Severity model

Strict checking rejects some valid Classic Refal-5 programs. That conflicts with
the conformance goal, so it is resolved with severity levels rather than by
changing the language.

| Severity | Meaning | `--classic` | `--strict` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic error` | A Classic Refal-5 spec violation | fails | fails |
| `proven defect` | A statically **proven** runtime failure, or provably dead code | reported | **fails** |
| `warning` | A **possible** failure under approximation | reported | reported |
| `note` | Opt-in pedantry: termination hints, open-`e` complexity | hidden | reported |

`--classic` accepts exactly what Turchin's Refal-5 accepts. **The language is
never modified — only the diagnostics differ.**

### Per-lint control

The mode sets the default level for every lint at once. `-W`, `-D` and `-A`
override one lint at a time, or all of them with `all`:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-W <lint>` | report as a `warning` |
| `-D <lint>` | raise to a `proven defect`, which `--strict` fails on |
| `-A <lint>` | suppress the diagnostic entirely |

The lints are `dead-sentence`, `recognition-impossible`, `builtin-domain` and
`open-expression-complexity`. Both `-W dead-sentence` and `-Wdead-sentence` are
accepted, and a later flag for the same lint wins.

**A lint flag cannot touch a spec violation.** Only diagnostics that carry a
lint are affected, and spec violations carry none, so no combination of flags
can make the compiler accept a program the reference rejects. A test asserts
this directly across `-A all`, `-W all` and `--strict -A all`.

Suppressing with `-A` is distinct from a lint whose *default* is `note`: the
open-`e` lint is hidden in `--classic` and visible under `--strict`, because
silencing opt-in pedantry by default would remove the reason to pass
`--strict`.

## Soundness rule

Every analysis in `crates/refal-semantics/src/lints.rs` must be **sound**: it may
miss a defect, but it must never report one that is not real. The gate is
`strict_mode_has_no_false_positives_on_the_corpus`, which runs `--strict` over
every non-`bad-*` example and fails on any rejection that is not already known
to be genuine.

Soundness is bought by under-approximating rather than over-approximating:

- Numeric literals are compared by their exact text. Deciding that `1` and `1.0`
  denote the same value is a separate question, so a subsumption check that
  cannot prove it says no.
- A `t.`- or `e.`-variable in the *specific* pattern is opaque. At run time it
  may denote a bracket, which an `s.`-variable cannot match, so an `s.`-variable
  is never assumed to cover it.
- The shape lattice keeps the three literal kinds apart — `C` character, `N`
  number, `I` identifier — because they can never coincide, and joins them back
  to `S` (any symbol) when they disagree. An `s.`-variable is `S`, never one of
  the three, so a callee that accepts only numbers does **not** refute it. That
  is the direction that matters: the widening has to buy precision without
  inventing a disjointness that is not there.

## Implemented checks

### Dead sentences — `proven defect`

Refal tries a function's sentences in order and commits to the first one whose
pattern matches. Once the left side has matched and its conditions have
succeeded, a failure inside the result propagates out rather than falling
through to a later sentence. So a sentence is dead when an **earlier** sentence
has **no conditions** and a pattern that matches everything the later one
matches.

Both restrictions are load-bearing. An earlier sentence with conditions lets
control through whenever a condition fails, and only earlier sentences can
shadow a later one.

Subsumption is decided by `pattern_subsumes`, which is Refal matching run
backwards: the general pattern's variables are the pattern variables, and the
specific pattern is matched against them as if it were an expression, with the
specific pattern's own variables standing for opaque values.

This check has already earned its place. It found a genuine ordering bug in
`examples/compiler-refal-lexer-subset.ref`, where `" "` preceded the more
specific `" = "` it shadowed.

### Recognition impossible — `proven defect`

*Recognition impossible* — no sentence matched — is Refal's dominant runtime
failure. A call is reported in two ways.

**Exact.** Every argument is a literal, so each sentence's pattern can be
decided against it; if none matches, the call cannot succeed.

**By format.** The argument's *format* is compared against the format the
callee accepts, and if the two cannot overlap then no argument can be accepted.
This sees past literals: `<OnlyBracket s.A>` is rejected because `s.` can only
denote a symbol while `OnlyBracket` accepts `[B]`. `Format::disjoint` answers
"definitely disjoint", never "definitely overlapping", so `?` overlaps with
everything and length ranges that merely might miss each other do not count.

The shape lattice keeps the three literal kinds apart — `C` character, `N`
number, `I` identifier — because they can never coincide, and joins them back to
`S` (any symbol) when they disagree. So `<F 'a'>` is refuted when `F` only
accepts numbers: `'a'` is `[C]`, `F` accepts `[N]`, and a character is never a
number. An `s.`-variable is `S`, never one of the three, so it is **not**
refuted by any single literal kind — which is the direction that keeps the
widening sound. A test pins that directly.

Both under-approximate: a sentence whose conditions would fail at run time is
still counted as matching, so neither can report a call that succeeds.

### Open-`e` complexity — `note`

Two `e.`-variables in one pattern is where matching stops being cheap: the
matcher has to guess where each one ends, and each split point of the first is
tried against each split point of the second. This is reported at `Allow`
severity, so it is opt-in pedantry — visible under `--strict`, silent
otherwise, and never fatal. No other Refal toolchain reports it.

### Builtin domain errors — `proven defect`

A call is only judged when **every** argument is a literal, so the value the
builtin will see is known at compile time and the failure is proven rather than
guessed. A call with a variable argument is left to the runtime.

| Call | Rejected when |
|---|---|
| `Add` `Sub` `Mul` `Compare` `Div` `Mod` `Divmod` | the literal argument leaves no second operand (`<Add 1>`) |
| `Div` `Mod` `Divmod` | the divisor is the literal `0` |
| `Numb` | the argument is not a non-empty string of decimal digits |

The static verdict mirrors the runtime's operand decoding
(`split_arithmetic_operands` and `parse_macrodigit` in
`crates/refal-runtime/src/interpreter.rs`), so the two cannot disagree about
what an integer operand denotes. §C.2 takes one macrodigit from the front of the
argument and gives the rest to the second operand when the round brackets are
omitted, so `<Add 1 2 3>` is the legal call `1 + (2 3)` and is not reported; a
bracketed, variable, or otherwise non-literal operand is left to the runtime.

A **real** literal is outside this check, because the decoder above reads
macrodigits only: `<Divmod 1.5 2>` and `<Div 1.0 0.0>` are refused when the
program runs (naming the builtin) rather than when it is checked. The guarantee
is one-directional — nothing is reported that is not proven — so leaving them to
the runtime cannot make a sound program fail `--strict`; it does mean a real
operand defect is not caught statically.

## Feasibility and termination, with certificates

`--strict` decides defects. It does not answer Turchin's §4.5 question — *is
every walk in this program feasible?* — and §5.8 Theorem 5.1 says no algorithm
can answer it universally: he proves it by reducing formal arithmetic in Refal to
Church's theorem, so it is a computability bound, not a tooling gap.

`refal feasibility <file.ref>` is the **sound, incomplete** answer. For every
sentence it decides one of three things and never guesses:

| Verdict | Meaning | Certificate |
|---|---|---|
| `feasible` | an input selects this sentence | the input itself |
| `infeasible` | no input selects it | the earlier sentence that shadows it |
| `unproven` | neither proven | — |

**A witness is a certificate, not a claim.** The synthesised input is *ground*,
and matching a ground expression against a pattern is decidable, so
`refal feasibility --certificate` re-checks every `feasible` line against the
source and exits non-zero if any claim fails. A ground input selects sentence *i*
exactly when it matches sentence *i*'s pattern and no earlier sentence's — and
earlier sentences are compared **ignoring their conditions**, which is the
conservative direction: a witness that fails to match an earlier pattern reaches
this sentence whether or not that sentence's conditions would have succeeded.

**Termination is decided by structural descent.** A function whose every
self-recursive call passes a **proper contiguous run** of its argument — with a
term *outside* that run that binds at least one term — strictly shrinks its
argument at every call, so length is a well-founded ranking and the run is the
witness. The second condition is load-bearing, not decoration:
`F { e.X e.Y = <F e.X>; }` is *not* proved, because `e.Y` may bind nothing and
`e.X` may then be the whole argument. `F { s.H e.T = <F s.H>; }` is not proved
either, and correctly so — it loops when `e.T` is empty.

**What is not decided is named, not hidden.** The command prints its `unproven`
set: the sentences whose selectability and the functions whose termination it
could not settle. That set is the honest measure of the analysis's reach, and it
is the thing a total decision procedure would have to be empty — which Theorem
5.1 says cannot always be arranged.

Measured on the corpus: **zero infeasible sentences across the 77 non-`bad-*`
examples** (no false positives — the soundness property holds end to end), with
the unproven set printed for each.

## Not yet implemented

- Bracket *contents* in the format lattice. `Shape::Bracket` is opaque, so
  `<F ('a')>` against a callee that only accepts `(1)` is not refuted. The
  contents would need their own format, which is a recursive extension of the
  lattice rather than another shape.
