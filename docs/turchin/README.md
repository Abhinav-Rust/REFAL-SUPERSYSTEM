# Turchin Primary Sources

This compiler is built to Valentin Turchin's own design. This directory indexes the primary
sources that design is drawn from, so that any claim in this repository can be checked against
the original text.

Run `cargo xtask fetch-sources` to download the nineteen scripted CS documents (~53 MB) into `docs/turchin/pdf/`. Three further documents were added from the Chief Architect's collection on 2026-09-08: the 1986 TOPLAS supercompiler paper, the 1993 JFP metasystem-transition paper, and the 1995 Dialogue. **22 documents, ~34 MB on disk.**
Every one has a machine-readable text layer; extract with `pdftotext <file>.pdf -`.

## Why the PDFs are not committed

`.gitignore` excludes `pdf/`. Three reasons:

1. **Copyright.** These are third-party scholarly works — Keldysh Institute preprints, a Courant
   Institute report, LNCS papers. Their redistribution terms are unclear. This repository is
   public and MIT-licensed, and the [clean-room policy](../CLEANROOM.md) commits us to careful
   provenance. Linking and scripted retrieval is unambiguous; bundling is not.
2. **Repository weight.** 53 MB of scanned PDFs would dominate a ~5,000-line source tree and be
   carried in every clone forever.
3. **Reproducibility beats bundling.** The script is 6 KB, verifies every download against an
   expected page count, and documents exactly how each file was located — including the six
   recovered from the Wayback Machine after the live mirror rotted.

If you want them versioned anyway, the options are Git LFS, a GitHub release asset, or a
separate archive repository. Say so and we will set one up.

The English documents are clean.

## The philosophical works (PW)

The CS corpus above fixes *how* the compiler is built. Turchin's philosophical
works fix *what it is for*, and this repository treats them as part of the
conformance target: a compiler that matches the manual but defeats the purpose
has not conformed.

| Document | Year | Pages | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **The Phenomenon of Science: A Cybernetic Approach to Human Evolution** | 1977 | 321 | live |

This is the book that introduces **metasystem transition** — Turchin's account of
how a new level of control arises above an existing one, in evolution, in
culture, and in computing. Refal was never only a pattern-matching language to
him; it was the concrete apparatus for the self-referential control relationship
he spent his life generalising. Supercompilation is metasystem transition applied
to a program: an interpreter is driven, and a compiler falls out.

What this obliges us to demonstrate, beyond syntax conformance:

- A **metasystem transition actually occurs** — an interpreter driven over a
  program yields a specialised residual program. This is the same move that gets
  a compiler out of an interpreter, and it is the heart of the claim.
- The compiler can be **applied to itself**, meaning the tool operates at the
  level above the one it was written at.
- The **honest limit is published**, not papered over (§5.8, Theorem 5.1).
  Turchin proved no algorithm perfects every graph of states. A system that
  claims otherwise has misunderstood him.

## Anchors this project depends on

- **§5.8, Theorem 5.1** — *"There exists no algorithm which could transform any graph of states
  into an equivalent perfect graph."* Proved by modelling formal arithmetic in Refal and reducing
  to Church's theorem. This is the hard ceiling on any guarantee this compiler can make about the
  code it accepts, and it is Turchin's own result.
- **§2.2 The Projecting Algorithm. Open and Closed e-Variables** — Turchin's own compiled
  pattern-matching plan, and his own treatment of open-`e` matching cost.
- **§2.3 Function Formats** — Turchin's own notion of function argument shape. Refal-6 and Refal
  Plus have comparable format declarations, but we take the idea from §2.3, which keeps the
  clean-room policy intact.
- **§4.2–4.6 Graph of States** — for Turchin, compilation *is* driving and generalisation over a
  graph of states. Code generation is one subsection, §4.7.
- **1971 Part V §1, «Компилирующие метафункции»** (*Compiling metafunctions*) — Turchin defines
  metafunctions as functions whose concretization controls the concretization of other functions,
  and splits them into compiling and interpreting classes. The 1971 seed of supercompilation.

## Dialect lineage

```
Refal (1966-68, Turchin) ── the metaalgorithmic language
  └─ Basic Refal ────────── the minimal core theorised over in 1971 Part III and 1980
      └─ Refal-2 (Romanenko et al.)   specifiers, boxes, long arithmetic
          └─ Refal-4 (Romanenko)
              └─ Refal-5 (TURCHIN, 1989; rev. 1999)   <-- this compiler targets Refal-5
                  ├─ Refal-6            actions, failures, boxes
                  ├─ Refal Plus         explicit input/output format declarations
                  ├─ Refal-5-lambda     strict superset + higher-order functions; → C++
                  ├─ Refal-05           minimalist teaching subset
                  └─ Refal-7            higher-order; drops pattern and result blocks
```

**Refal-5 is Turchin's own dialect**, defined in *Refal-5: Programming Guide and Reference
Manual* (New England Publishing Co., Holyoke, 1989; revised and extended 1999). Sergei Romanenko
authored Refal-2, Refal-4 and Refal Plus, and curates the Keldysh archive — which is why his name
appears throughout the file paths. That is custodianship, not authorship of Refal-5.

## Link-rot notes

The five 1971 PDF URLs on `pat.keldysh.ru` are genuine and published on the official REFAL
Institute index, but now return HTTP 404. Verified 2026-08-05 with literal `'`, with `%27`, over
HTTP and HTTPS, default and browser user-agents — all 404. The Apache directory listing of
`/~roman/doc/Turchin/` holds exactly five files, none of them the 1971 preprints. Encoding is not
the cause: the 1972 file in that directory has a literal apostrophe and downloads fine.

This is link rot on the mirror, not a bad citation. All five are recovered from Wayback, and the
retrieved page counts match the catalogue: 57/60/54/48/56 against advertised 55/60/53/47/55.
Same story for the 1968 ALGOL translator, 1975 macrocode, 1988, 1990 ch. 3 and ch. 6, and 1996
generalization of lists.
